I chose it because its technology stack overlapped significantly with what I was studying at university. Having previously developed a pure front-end e-commerce website project using React, the front-end part of this project wasn\u0026rsquo;t very challenging for me. However, what made this project meaningful was that it exposed me to the framework of a complete web product and the general steps required to complete it. This project served as an excellent practice opportunity, and I highly recommend it to software engineering students. Additionally, I deployed the application on AWS, adding a practical aspect of cloud deployment to my learning experience.\nDevelopment Process Technology Stack and Tools To build the Employee Management System, I used the following technologies and tools:\nBackend: Spring Boot 3: To provide the server-side infrastructure and business logic. Spring Data JPA (Hibernate 6): For data persistence. MySQL Database: As the database management system. IntelliJ IDEA: As the integrated development environment (IDE). Maven: For project build and dependency management. Postman: For testing REST APIs. Frontend: React JS 18+: For building user interfaces. Vite JS: As the build tool. Bootstrap CSS: For styling web pages. JavaScript: The primary scripting language. NPM: For package management. Visual Studio Code (VS Code): As the IDE. Axios: For making HTTP requests. Project Modules and Development Steps Employee Management System Backend Development:\nDefined the employee entity with fields such as id, name, department, and salary. Created a repository interface for database operations. Developed REST APIs for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting employees. Frontend Development:\nCreated React components for listing, adding, updating, and deleting employees. Implemented form handling and validation for employee data. Used Axios to make API calls and integrate the frontend with the backend services. Challenges and Solutions Challenge 1: Managing State in React Solution: Implemented React hooks to manage state and lifecycle methods effectively. Used context API for global state management.\nChallenge 2: Securing REST APIs Solution: Integrated Spring Security and JWT to secure REST APIs. Configured roles and permissions to ensure authorized access.\nChallenge 3: Database Integration and Migrations Solution: Used Spring Data JPA with MySQL for seamless database operations. Leveraged Liquibase for database migrations and version control.\nChallenge 4: Form Validation and Error Handling Solution: Implemented both client-side and server-side validation. Used React\u0026rsquo;s form handling capabilities and Spring Boot\u0026rsquo;s validation annotations to ensure data integrity.\nProject Outcomes Built a robust Employee Management application with seamless backend and frontend integration. Gained proficiency in Spring Boot, React JS, Spring Security, and JWT. Overcame various challenges, enhancing problem-solving and debugging skills. Future Improvements Already achieved: After completing the development, I took the additional step of deploying the Employee Management System on AWS. This involved setting up an EC2 instance, configuring the environment, and deploying the backend and frontend applications. The process of deploying to AWS not only gave me hands-on experience with cloud services but also showcased the real-world applicability of my project. Add more features such as advanced search, filters, and reporting in the Employee Management System. Optimize the application for better performance, particularly in handling large datasets. Enhance the UI/UX by incorporating advanced design patterns and interactive elements.

The primary goal was to practice integrating complex front-end technologies and libraries such as React Router 6, Redux Toolkit, and Stripe Checkout. The project also included deployment to Netlify and payment processing using Stripe. This project provided valuable experience in combining multiple tools and concepts into a cohesive and interactive shopping platform.\nDevelopment Process Technology Stack and Tools Frontend: React (with Router 6): For managing the user interface and navigation between pages. Redux Toolkit: For managing state across the application. Stripe API: For processing payments. Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend. Netlify: For deployment and setting up serverless functions. Backend: Netlify Functions: For handling serverless backend requests, such as payment processing via Stripe. Stripe API: To set up payment gateways for purchases made in the store. Project Modules and Key Features The project is divided into several key modules that drive the functionality of the e-commerce website:\nNavigation Bar and Theme:\nThe navigation bar contains links to various pages, including the homepage, product page, and cart. The project allows users to navigate seamlessly between different pages.\nProduct Listing and Single Product Pages:\nThe homepage showcases featured products, and users can navigate to individual product pages where they can view product details, such as price, description, available colors, and add items to the cart.\nProduct Filters and Pagination:\nUsers can filter products by categories, such as price, company, or color, and view products in grid or list formats. The website also features pagination for easy navigation through a large product catalog.\nCart Functionality:\nOnce items are added to the cart, users can modify the quantities or remove products. The cart page dynamically updates the total cost based on the selected quantity.\nUser Authentication and Checkout:\nThe store has an authentication system where users can log in or sign up. For ease, there is also a \u0026ldquo;guest checkout\u0026rdquo; option. After logging in, additional pages such as Checkout and Orders become available.\nStripe Checkout: Integrated for secure payment processing. Customers can finalize purchases after completing the checkout form. Integration with Stripe One of the most challenging parts of this project was integrating the Stripe API for payment processing. I first created a backend function on Netlify to handle the payment setup (/create-payment-setup) and retrieve a client secret. This client secret is then used to complete the payment through Stripe\u0026rsquo;s checkout system.\nHere are the main steps I followed for the Stripe integration:\nSetup: Installed the Stripe library and set up a function to handle payments. Stripe Checkout: Managed payment state variables and client-side logic for handling successful payments. Confirmation: Implemented a return page to display the order confirmation to users once a payment is successfully completed. Deployment to Netlify After building and testing the site locally, I deployed it on Netlify. Netlify\u0026rsquo;s serverless functions proved to be particularly useful for handling the backend payment logic, making the deployment process smoother.\nChallenges and Solutions Challenge 1: State Management Managing the state across different components, especially when it comes to the cart and payment processes, was complex. I used Redux Toolkit to handle global state management, making the process more efficient and scalable.\nChallenge 2: Stripe API Integration The Stripe payment setup required proper handling of the client-side and backend logic. I resolved this by using Netlify functions to handle payment intents securely, and managed the state using React hooks to maintain the current state of the checkout process.\nChallenge 3: Error Handling and Authentication I faced issues managing errors during checkout and login. To resolve this, I implemented both front-end and back-end error handling. Additionally, I used Auth0 for secure user authentication and authorization.\nProject Outcomes This e-commerce store is fully functional with product listings, filters, cart, and payment features. It also includes error pages and dynamic product rendering based on user interaction.\nKey takeaways from this project include:\nProficiency in React, Redux, and Stripe API. Experience with state management, payment processing, and deployment on Netlify. The successful creation of a scalable and responsive web application, accessible on various screen sizes. Future Improvements In the future, I plan to extend the Comfy Store project by adding the following features:\nProduct Reviews: Allow users to leave reviews on products they purchase. Order History: Implement order tracking and more detailed user profiles to review previous purchases. Enhanced UI/UX: Improve the overall user experience with more interactive design elements, including animations and transitions.
