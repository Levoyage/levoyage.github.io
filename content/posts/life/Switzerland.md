## ‚è∞ Day 1Ô∏è‚É£: Arrival in Switzerland

My solo journey began from Dublin Airport ‚úàÔ∏è to Zurich Airport, arriving around 4 PM. The Zurich Airport vibe was cool‚Äîthink minimalist German aesthetics in black, white, and grey. Swiss Airlines even threw in complimentary water and chocolate. I immediately felt loved.

From the airport, I hopped onto a cute mini train at Gate E, breezed through customs, and was delighted to find the railway station right outside. A two-hour train ride landed me in Wilderswil, a small, pitch-dark town near Interlaken around 7:30 PM. To celebrate surviving the darkness, I ventured bravely into Interlaken to hunt for Korean food. The pork with spicy sauce was decent!

Checked into Jungfrau Hotel, charming with its mountain-view terrace perfect for Instagramming snowy peaks at breakfast. The bathroom might have lacked warmth (literally no heating), and I swear the walls were made from paper, but hey, great location and cheaper than Interlaken‚ÄîI'm not complaining!

## ‚è∞ Day 2Ô∏è‚É£: First Mountain & Grindelwald

Accidentally took the wrong train in the morning (early train arrivals = traps) but still made it to Grindelwald at 9:20 AM, joining a confusing queue thanks to broken ticket machines and people staring at them like modern art exhibits.

Eventually got the "Adventure Package" for First Mountain (after Swiss logic baffled me‚Äîwhy limit online bookings?). The cable car up was shared with a family who kindly chatted about Bachalpsee Lake‚Äîtoo bad no one mentioned it would be under snow!

Climbed painfully uphill, shedding layers dramatically. My soul momentarily left when I saw the lake was just white snow‚Äîso much for photos. On the bright side, scenic views and random mountain goats cheered me up.

Next, tackled the cliff walk (less dramatic than expected) and bravely faced the cold on the Flyer zip line‚Äîbeside screaming tourists, I remained impressively emotionless (just freezing). The Glider was next, feeling genuinely bird-like, though equally cold. Later, snow-sledding became an adventure of nearly flipping over and awkwardly braking my shoes (safe!).

Wrapped up by exploring Grindelwald‚Äôs "magical" snowy slopes, which felt more icy apocalypse than winter wonderland in photos. Maybe summer would be kinder?

## ‚è∞ Day 3Ô∏è‚É£: Lake Lucerne, Mt. Rigi & Lucerne City

Took the famous Golden Pass train to Lucerne. Brienz Lake was postcard-perfect, Sarnersee not so much. At Lucerne, boarded a freezing boat to Vitznau, capturing blurry snow mountains through dense fog.

Hopped onto a cogwheel train to Mt. Rigi, mistakenly photographing scenery from the wrong side initially. The peak views were spectacular, despite snow covering half the path. Took the cable car down to Weggis, sprinted downhill to catch another boat (fitness goals achieved).

Lucerne was chaos due to Carnival‚Äîstreets blocked, but at least I saw a fun parade. Checked out the dying lion monument (heartbreaking beauty), speed-walked through Glacier Garden, and survived a mirror maze with minimal head bump. Ended the day with live music at the station and delicious Shin Ramyun‚Äîtrue happiness!

## ‚è∞ Day 4Ô∏è‚É£: Four Little Towns & M√§nnlichen Mountain

Started late, found Lauterbrunnen disappointingly grey (snow melting season is rough). Quickly moved on to picturesque M√ºrren via cable car‚Äîviews were fantastic, the village charmingly perched on cliffs.

Then down to Wengen, impulsively decided to conquer M√§nnlichen's "Royal Walk," powered by amusing treasure hunts. The top rewarded my sweaty effort with stunning panoramic views and amusing novice-friendly ski slopes.

Ended the day exploring picturesque Spiez‚Äîmissed the castle, but lake reflections made up for it.

Back to my cozy hotel, feeling victorious and ready for more noodles.

## ‚è∞ Day 5Ô∏è‚É£: Zurich City & Return Home

Caught the train at 8:40 from Wilderswil, arriving in Zurich around 11:30 after missing a transfer due to smartphone distractions (classic traveler fail). Quickly visited the National Museum, which felt confusing but had an awesome 19th-century pharmacy exhibit‚Äîperfect inspiration for my final project!

Next, zipped up the Polybahn funicular for a quick photo op at the ETH viewing platform (full of sunbathing locals‚ÄîSwitzerland knows leisure).

Grabbed a quick sushi lunch from Migros (cheap sushi in Switzerland? Yes, please!) and caught my train to Zurich Airport. Breezed through security (minus a minor water-bottle hiccup), boarded my flight smoothly, and arrived back in Dublin perfectly timed to catch the 18:15 bus home. Swiss efficiency at its finest!
